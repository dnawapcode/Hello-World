👋 Guide to Collaborating with Me

Welcome! This repository includes my work, experiments, and ideas.
Before diving in, here’s a quick guide on how to best interact and collaborate with me.

🧑 About Me

Product Manager with a B2B2C focus – I work on opportunities, recommendations, dashboards, and marketplace products.

Strong interest in E-commerce, data visualization, AI/ML applications, and creative tech.

I enjoy problem-solving (math puzzles with my daughter, step challenges with my team, research on admin/user experience).

I like things to be minimalistic, structured, and purposeful — whether in design, writing, or code.

💬 Communication Style

Structured & clear: I prefer things laid out logically (tables, matrices, scorecards, dashboards, or step-by-step instructions).

Exploration-friendly: I ask a lot of “what if” questions to explore options before deciding.

Visual-first: Graphs, mockups, and clean layouts help me think better than long text walls.

Iterative: Don’t worry about perfection on the first go — I like improving drafts together.

✅ How to Work With Me

Provide concise summaries first, then go deeper if needed.

Show examples, visuals, or frameworks (e.g., 2x2 matrices, roadmaps, trackers).

Call out assumptions clearly if the answer depends on context.

If something has multiple approaches, outline the trade-offs.

I value neutral/objective tones over marketing-speak.

🚫 What to Avoid

Overly generic answers without context.

Walls of unstructured text — it makes extracting insights harder.

Overconfidence without clarity on limitations or freshness of data.


🛠 Tools & Workflows

Comfortable with Excel, Python, and AI-assisted workflows.

Use structured documents and trackers for collaboration.

Prefer clear file naming conventions and self-explanatory content.

🤝 Contribution

Fork > Draft > PR with clear context.

Summarize your proposal in 3–5 bullet points before deep detail.

Keep tone professional yet human — I value curiosity, humor, and thoughtfulness.
